## User Stories

| **ID** | **User Story** | **Acceptance Criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | As a movie fan, I want to see a list of films with key info, so that I can quickly spot something interesting to watch. | • When I visit /films, I see a grid/list of films from /api/films/. <br> • Each film card shows poster, title, year, and average_rating (or "No ratings yet"). <br> • If the API is loading, a spinner/skeleton is shown. <br> • If the API fails, an error message is shown with a retry option. |
| 2 | As a movie fan, I want to search and filter films, so that I can easily find films matching what I'm in the mood for. | • A search box lets me search films by title (calls /api/films/?search= or similar). <br> • I can filter by at least genre and year using dropdowns/controls. <br> • Applying filters updates the list without a full page reload. <br> • Clearing filters returns me to the default film list. <br> • URL or component state reflects current filters (so navigation feels consistent). |
| 3 | As a movie fan, I want a film detail page, so that I can see full information before deciding to watch it. | • When I click a film card, I'm taken to /films/:id. <br> • The page fetches /api/films/{id} and shows: title, year, overview, poster, runtime, genres, keywords, people, average_rating, review_count. <br> • If the film is not found (404), I see a friendly "Film not found" message and a link back to the films list. <br> • The page is readable and usable on mobile, tablet, and desktop. |
| 4 | As a new user, I want to create an account, so that I can save favourites, watchlists, and reviews. | • A Register page has a form with at least username, email (optional), password, confirm password. <br> • Client-side validation checks required fields and basic password rules. <br> • On submit, the frontend calls the backend auth/registration endpoint. <br> • On success, I'm either logged in automatically or redirected to the login page with a success message. <br> • On validation error (e.g. username taken), inline error messages are shown. |
| 5 | As a returning user, I want to log in and out, so that my personal data is secure and tied to my account. | • A Login page accepts username/email and password. <br> • Successful login stores the JWT/session in a secure place. <br> • The navigation bar clearly indicates when I'm logged in (e.g. "Hi, username" and a logout button). <br> • Logout clears stored auth data and returns me to a public page. <br> • Auth-only buttons (favourite, watchlist, review) are hidden or disabled when logged out. |
| 6 | As a user, I want to always know if I'm logged in, so that I understand what actions I can perform. | • The navbar shows different options depending on login state (e.g. Login/Register vs Profile/Logout). <br> • If my token/session is invalid or expired, I am logged out gracefully and shown a message. <br> • Protected pages redirect to login (or show a message) if I'm not authenticated. |
| 7 | As a logged-in user, I want to rate and review a film, so that I can share my opinion with others. | • On /films/:id, logged-in users see a Review form with rating (1–10) and text fields. <br> • Validation: rating is required and within 1–10, text has a sensible max length. <br> • On submit, the frontend calls the reviews API to create/update the review for that film. <br> • The backend enforces one review per user per film; if a review already exists, the form loads existing data for editing. <br> • On success, the review list and film's average_rating/review_count update without a full page refresh. <br> • On error (validation / server), an inline message is shown. |
| 8 | As a logged-in user, I want to edit or delete my review, so that I can correct or remove it later. | • In the review list, my own review is clearly marked and shows Edit and Delete options. <br> • Edit opens the same review form prefilled with existing content. <br> • Delete asks for confirmation (e.g. simple modal/confirm dialog). <br> • After edit or delete succeeds, the film's review list and aggregate rating are updated. <br> • I cannot edit or delete other users' reviews (no buttons shown and protected by backend permissions). |
| 9 | As a logged-in user, I want to like helpful reviews, so that the best opinions are surfaced. | • Every review (except my own) shows a Like button and like count. <br> • Clicking like sends a request to the review-like API (toggle behaviour). <br> • Liking again unlikes the review. <br> • The like count updates immediately after success. <br> • If I'm logged out and click like, I'm prompted to log in (or shown a message). |
| 10 | As a logged-in user, I want to report harmful or inappropriate reviews, so that moderators can act on them. | • Each review has a Report button or menu option. <br> • Clicking it sends a request to the report endpoint. <br> • A success message confirms the report was submitted. <br> • A reported review will not show up for me anymore. |
| 11 | As a logged-in user, I want to favourite/unfavourite films, so that I can maintain a quick access list of my top picks. | • On film cards and the film detail page, I see a favourite toggle (icon/button) when logged in. <br> • The initial state uses is_favourited from /api/films/ to show on/off. <br> • Clicking it calls the favourites API (create or delete) and immediately updates the icon state. <br> • My favourites are only visible/linked to my account. <br> • If the API fails, an error message is shown and the UI reverts to the previous state. |
| 12 | As a logged-in user, I want a dedicated favourites page, so that I can quickly find films I've marked as favourites. | • A Favourites page lists my favourited films using the same FilmCard component. <br> • List is loaded from a favourites or films endpoint filtered by the current user. <br> • Clicking a card navigates to the film detail page. <br> • If I have no favourites, a friendly empty-state message is shown with a call to action (e.g. "Browse films to start favouriting"). |
| 13 | As a logged-in user, I want to add films to named watchlists, so that I can organise what to watch next (e.g. "Date Night", "Halloween"). | • On a film detail page, I see a "Add to watchlist" control (e.g. button + dropdown). <br> • I can pick from my existing lists (e.g. "Watchlist", "Halloween Picks") or create a new list name in a small form. <br> • The request uses the watchlists API and respects the unique constraint (user_id, name, film_id) (no duplicates in the same list). <br> • On success, I see confirmation (toast/inline message). <br> • If I'm not logged in, I'm asked to log in instead. |
| 14 | As a logged-in user, I want to see and manage my watchlists, so that I can keep them tidy and up to date. | • A Watchlists or Profile page shows all my lists grouped by list name. <br> • Within each list, I see FilmCards for each film. <br> • I can remove a film from a list. <br> • Optionally, I can rename or delete entire lists. <br> • UI stays in sync after operations. |
| 15 | As a logged-in user, I want to select two films and get blended recommendations, so that my partner/friend/... and I can find a compromise film. | • A "Blend Mode" page lets me pick Film A and Film B (e.g. search/autocomplete fields). <br> • Submitting calls /api/blend/?film_a=&film_b=. <br> • The API returns up to 5 recommended films; these are shown as FilmCards with a short "fit score". <br> • If no matches are found, a clear message is shown. <br> • Only logged-in users can access this page or submit the form. |
| 16 | As a user, I want clear loading and error feedback, so that I understand what the app is doing. | • Major data-fetching areas (film list, film detail, profile) show visible loading indicators. <br> • Network/API errors display user-friendly messages. <br> • Retry actions are available where appropriate (e.g. "Try again" button). <br> • Validation errors on forms are shown next to the relevant fields. |
| 17 | As a user, I want the app to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it comfortably on different devices. | • Key pages (home/films list, film detail, login/register, profile) are usable on mobile, tablet, and desktop. <br> • Interactive elements (buttons, inputs) are keyboard-focusable and have visible focus states. <br> • Images include meaningful alt text where relevant. <br> • Colour contrast is sufficient for text and important UI elements. |

## Design Decisions & Justification (Distinction)

### Authentication Strategy – JWT

**JWT authentication** was chosen over session-based authentication because:

- It supports a clean separation between React frontend and Django REST backend
- Tokens can be securely stored and reused across page refreshes
- It simplifies protected route handling on the frontend
- It aligns with modern SPA best practices

This approach also supports future extensibility (e.g. mobile clients) without changing authentication logic.

---

### State Management – React + Context

FilmHive uses **React state and context** with Axios for data fetching:

- Local component state for view-level UI concerns (inputs, modals, filters)
- Contexts/hooks (e.g., auth, notifications) for cross-cutting app state
- Axios handles server requests; responses update component or context state

This keeps the stack lightweight and aligned with what is actually installed.

---

### Film Data Strategy – Hybrid TMDB Caching

FilmHive uses a **hybrid data strategy**:

- Film metadata is sourced from the **TMDB API**
- Data is cached locally in the backend database when accessed

This approach was chosen to:

- Avoid repeated external API calls
- Improve response times for commonly accessed films
- Allow relational features (reviews, favourites, watchlists)
- Maintain data consistency across users

This also supports a controlled **seed strategy**, ensuring the platform is populated with meaningful data while avoiding unnecessary bloat.

---

## Data Flow & Architecture

### High-Level Flow

1. React frontend requests data via Axios
2. Django REST API processes requests
3. JWT middleware validates authentication (if required)
4. Database handles relational user interactions
5. React components/contexts update UI state based on API responses

### Key Principles

- **Thin frontend, authoritative backend**
- **One review per user per film enforced server-side**
- **Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure**
- **Graceful error handling and retry mechanisms**

This architecture ensures data integrity while keeping the user experience responsive.

---

## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility was considered throughout development and validated using **Lighthouse audits**.

Implemented features include:

- Full **keyboard navigation** across interactive elements
- **Visible focus states** for buttons and links
- Semantic HTML structure (proper use of buttons, labels, headings)
- Meaningful **alt text** for images
- Colour contrast checks with no Lighthouse flags raised

The application achieves an **accessibility score of ~81**, which reflects intentional effort within MVP scope, with room for improvement in future iterations.

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Context API for State Management**
- `AuthContext` - User authentication state
- `FavoritesContext` - Favorite films management
- `WatchlistsContext` - Watchlist management
- `NotificationContext` - Global notifications

**Custom Hooks**
- `useFilmSearch` - Search and filter logic
- `useFilmFilters` - Filter state management
- `useInfiniteScroll` - Infinite scrolling implementation
- `useFavorites` - Favorite actions
- `useReviews` - Review CRUD operations
- `useWatchlists` - Watchlist management
- `useBlendMode` - Blend mode algorithm

**Service Layer**
- `api.js` - Axios configuration and interceptors
- `filmService.js` - Film-related API calls
- `reviewService.js` - Review API endpoints

## Future Improvements

- **Social Features**: User following, public profiles, shared watchlists
- **Advanced Recommendations**: Machine learning-based personalization
- **Streaming Integration**: Direct links to streaming services
- **Mobile App**: Native iOS and Android applications
- **Discussion Forums**: Film discussion boards and threads
- **Watch Together**: Virtual watch party feature
- **Actor/Director Pages**: Detailed filmography pages
- **List Collections**: Public themed lists and rankings
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization (i18n)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking and insights
